      "content": "The key differences between the Garmin Forerunner 970 and the Apple Watch Series 11 are as follows:\n\n1. **Battery Life**: The Garmin Forerunner 970 boasts a multi-week endurance with a 15-day battery life [3], whereas the Apple Watch Series 11 offers about a day and a half of usage on a single charge [7]. This makes the Garmin more suitable for extended outdoor activities without frequent recharging.\n\n2. **Design and Build**: The Garmin Forerunner 970 features a bright screen protected by sapphire glass, enhancing durability [3]. In contrast, the Apple Watch Series 11 retains a sleek design with a thickness of just 9.7mm, making it one of the thinnest smartwatches available [5][6].\n\n3. **Health and Fitness Features**: The Garmin watch introduces new running metrics and includes a voice-based offline assistant [2], while the Apple Watch Series 11 enhances health tracking with blood oxygen monitoring and maintains a robust suite of fitness features [7]. \n\n4. **User Interface and Software**: The Garmin Forerunner 970 has a reworked user interface that integrates fitness and smartwatch features more closely [1]. The Apple Watch Series 11 runs on watchOS 26, which is known for its smooth performance and user-friendly experience [7].\n\n5. **Price**: The Garmin Forerunner 970 is priced at £629.99 [3], which is significantly higher than typical pricing for the Apple Watch Series 11, although specific pricing for the Apple Watch isn't provided in the sources.\n\nThese differences highlight the Garmin Forerunner 970 as a more specialized device for serious athletes, while the Apple Watch Series 11 offers a balanced approach for everyday use and health tracking.",
