      "content": "The Garmin Forerunner 970 has a battery life of up to 15 days in smartwatch mode, which is a decrease from the previous model's 23 days [1], [3]. In always-on mode, it lasts for 8 days, an improvement from 7 days [1], [3]. For GPS usage, the 970 offers a maximum of 26 hours, which is lower than the 36 hours provided by its predecessor [1], [3].\n\nIn comparison, the Apple Watch Series 11 boasts a battery life of 24 hours under typical use and can extend up to 38 hours in Low Power Mode [4], [5]. This means that while the Garmin excels in smartwatch mode longevity, the Apple Watch offers superior performance in terms of daily usage and low power efficiency.",
